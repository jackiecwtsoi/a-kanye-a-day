# A Kanye A Day

This is a RESTful API that collects and displays quotes from a number of public free quote APIs.
This application is built using Java 19 and the Spring Boot framework.

## Setup
### Opening in IntelliJ
1. File -> Open -> Select -> OK -> Open as Project
2. File -> Settings -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> Build Tools -> Maven -> Runner -> JDK
3. Maven -> Reload project

## Running the program
After the initial Maven build you should see some pre-defined run configurations. 
Click on Run to start the Spring Boot web app.

## Development
### Branch conventions


### Pull requests
- If you wish t o make changes to the code, work on your own branch by adhering to the above branch conventions.
- Once you have finished your code change:
  1. Conduct a full test of your code change in your **own branch** first;
  2. If your tests are successful, commit and push your change to your **own branch**;
  3. Create a **pull request** from your own branch, and wait for the reviewer to check and approve your changes;
  4. Once your changes are reviewed and if there are no further issues, the reviewer will then merge your code changes with the ```main``` branch.

The above procedure is in place so that we are on top of all our code changes and nothing gets out of control. 
The ```main``` branch is the branch that gets periodically deployed to production, so we need to make sure everything works fine before making changes there.
Thank you for understanding.
